---- Task0.py ----

Order: O(1)
Explanation: In this case, there's no variance in the time the functions will take to run as the function will
always try to do the same thing regardless of the input: access an index of a list, making it O(1).

---- Task1.py ----

Order: O(n)
Explanation: This one is of the order O(n) because it will iterate over the input, so the time it will
take to complete depends on the amount of lines in that input (in this case, a list), making it run in linear time.

---- Task2.py ----

Order: O(n^2)
Explanation: This one runs quadratically because I wrote a for loop inside another for loop.

---- Task3.py ----

Order: O(n)
Explanation: This one is linear because I'm only iterating once over the input, so the time will vary according
to the size of that input.

---- Task4.py ----

Order: O(n^2)
Explanation: This is quadratic as well because I have for loop iterations inside a for loop iteration in detect_telemarketers().
